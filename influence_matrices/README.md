Due to their large size, the influence matrices must be downloaded separately from
[compbio.cs.brown.edu/projects/hotnet/](http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/projects/hotnet/).

Note that the example configuration files included with the code assume that the influence matrices
have been downloaded and saved to this directory with their default names.
